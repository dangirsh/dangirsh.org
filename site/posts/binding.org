title: Don't Cry for HAL (WIP)

I don't think that computers[fn:1] will ever wake up, no matter what software they are running. In this post, I'll present my version of a lesser-known argument[fn:3] for this stance, which I first learned from [[https://qri.org/][QRI]] [[https://qualiacomputing.com/2023/10/26/the-view-from-my-topological-pocket-an-introduction-to-field-topology-for-solving-the-boundary-problem/][here]][fn:4].

The main idea focuses on an aspect of consciousness[fn:2] called "global binding"[fn:5], which is the deceptively simple observation that we are /simultaneously/ aware of the contents of our experience. In other words, we have a experiential "now" with rich structures in it. To make my point, I'll only need to use a simplification of global binding: the simultaneous experience of two events.

I'll show that, under certain assumptions about consciousness, the framework of computation cannot account for global binding. I then discuss the implications of this conclusion, including the option of questioning the assumptions.

I try to assume minimal background knowledge in this post, since I believe this argument merits wider awareness.

* A Case for Conscious Computers

Why would someone expect a computer to be conscious in the first place?

Computational accounts for consciousness are [[https://cimc.ai/][in vogue]].  Their detractors risk being characterized as scientifically illiterate, carbon chauvinists[fn:19], or hyperfixated on microtubules[fn:20]. What makes the proponents so sure that consciousness is a property of computation?

One solid way to conclude that a computer could /in principle/ be conscious goes like this[fn:6]:

1. Consciousness is generated by the brain.
2. Physical systems like the brain can be perfectly simulated[fn:7] on a computer.
3. A perfectly-simulated brain would have the same properties as the original, consciousness included.

There are strong reasons to believe in each of these and they imply that a powerful-enough computer, running the right program, will wake up[fn:8].

This conclusion is deeply seductive to technologists. If true, we can understand the brain as a sophisticated biological computer[fn:22]. If true, we may one day upload our minds onto immortal computational substrates[fn:9]. And, if true, we might build a conscious AI that's a worthy successor to humanity[fn:21].

The stakes couldn't be higher!

* A Case Against Conscious Computers

The present argument against conscious computers takes aim at #3 above and suggests that no computation, not even a perfect brain simulation, can have a conscious experience.

At a high-level, the argument goes like this:

1. Observe that you can consciously experience two events as either simultaneous or not.
2. Assume that this fact can be derived by analyzing your brain.
3. Expect the same for a hypothetically conscious computer (swapping "brain" for "computer") and find that the assumption fails!

Specifically, we'll see that no computation can implement the experience of simultaneity. Of course, a computer can /report/ "seeing" two events as simultaneous or not. This functional[fn:32] account of simultaneity is not in question. We're interested in whether /the experience of simultaneity itself/ can be implemented on a computer, not in its downstream report.

One possible conclusion from this is that computation is not a suitable framework for explaining global binding, and is therefore insufficient to account for our conscious experience. Alternatively, we might have a bad assumption about consciousness. We'll explore both options.

Let's do a thought experiment to make things more concrete.

Imagine that you and your robot friend named "HAL" are watching a fierce lightning storm. HAL claims to be consciously experiencing the storm alongside you. You want to verify this claim.

You notice that sometimes two lightning bolts strike simultaneously. Other times, there's a barely perceptable delay between strikes. You and HAL always agree on whether the strikes are simultaneous or not.

[[../img/theda-lightning.jpeg]]

Now, imagine a device called a "qualiascope"[fn:24] that reports the contents of conscious experiences. When point it at you, it accurately reports whether you're experiencing two simultaneous lightning strikes or not

*Will the qualiascope work on HAL*?

* What Might a Qualiascope Measure?

Let's assume a qualiascope can be built without violating the laws of physics[fn:35]. How might it work? What could it measure to determine if the lightning strikes are experinced simultaneously or not?

Your first guess may be that qualiascopes could measure some relevant events in your brain (e.g. neurons firing) or HAL's processor (e.g. bit flips) and then infer the simultaneity of the experience based on the simultaneity of these events. However, simultaneity is only defined relative to a measurement frame[fn:29]. Which is the right frame to use here? What's more, we should expect the fact of whether the strikes are simultaneous (or not) /in a conscious experience/ to be independent of the measurement frame. After all, what you're experiencing is independent of who is asking about it! This reasoning makes the simulteneity of events a dubious candidate for the source of the qualiascope's measurements.

Another option is that the experience of simulteneity is directly encoded in the physical state of the brain/processor. As we just saw, this would have to go beyond the simulteneity of physical events. The most obvious option would be quantum entanglement. This is because entanglement creates a /indivisible whole/ out of many parts, providing a way to objectively link two events to the same "moment" of experience. There are many open questions about this idea, including the question of whether entanglement is even meaningfully present in the brain[fn:34][fn:33]. There are also ways of interpreting entanglement that make it merely a property of our limited models of reality, not a property of physical states[fn:16]. For now, let's categorize this idea as coherent but far from definitive. If it's true, then HAL is simply missing this magic glue (at least until it's upgraded to use a quantum processor).

A final option is that the qualiascope analyzes the way the brain processes information about each lightning strike: maybe there's some signature in the processing that indicates whether the events are experienced simultaneously or not. In this option, the qualiascope effectively treats the brain as a biological computer. It also suggests that the binding we seek is a virtual, not physical, property. So, we might expect the same approach to work if we point the qualiascope at HAL...

* Pointing the Qualiascope at HAL

Unlike the brain, there is no mystery about HAL's mechanism: we can fully understand what the qualiascope has access to within the framework of computation. So, is there some structure in HAL's computation that could implement the experience of simultaneous lightning strikes?

This is tricky because, consciousness aside, it's not obvious how to think about a computation's structure: a function can be computed by different algorithms (e.g. bubble or merge sort), algorithms have multiple implementations (e.g. serial or parallel), and these implementations can run on many different physical substrates (e.g. silicon or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo8izCKHiF0][wood]])[fn:11]. What is the essence of a computation that's relevant for understanding its conscious experience?

One approach is to recognize that conscious states must participate in /causality/ to be measurable by the qualiascope. This suggests the /causal structure/ of a computation is a valid representation for the source of the qualiascope's measurements: if there's some aspect of a computation not captured by its causal structure, then /by definition/ it can't affect the output of the qualiascope and is therefore irrelevant in this context.

But what exactly is a computation's causal structure? It's commonly represented as a graph, where the nodes represent events (e.g. bit flips) and the directed edges represent causal dependence between events[fn:27]. This causal graph is invariant to changes in details like the physical properties of the computer, how information is encoded, and the order of causally-independent events[fn:12].

#+ATTR_HTML: :style width:60%;max-width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block
[[../img/wolfram-causal-graph.png]]

Another reason to consider the causal structure comes from taking an /internal perspective/ on a computation. Imagine an AI exploring a self-contained virtual world. What can it learn, in principle, about its situation? Very simply, it can take actions, record observations, and build predictive models. Critically, it can never learn, for example, if it's running on a CPU or GPU. That's because it can /only infer the causal structure/ of its virtual world, which could be physically implemented in many different ways. The same argument applies to an AI building a model of another AI's consciousness: only the causal structure is available!

* Finding Binding

Let's imagine that the qualiascope can identify which events in HAL's causal graph correspond to the "sub-experience" of each lightning strike[fn:36]. How might it determine if HAL sees them at the same time?

As we already discussed, the answer isn't as simple as: "compare the times that the events occurred". The simultaneity of events depends on an arbitrary measurement frame, which doesn't fit with the objective nature of experienced simultaneity. Even worse, this approach uses information that's not present in the graph structure (i.e. physical time).

A more promising idea is to define some internal perspective in the causal graph and then define simultaneity relative to this perspective. This is a key idea in [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1667][Observer-Centric Physics]] and [[https://www.wolframphysics.org/][Wolfram Physics]]. The issue with these approaches is they only sharply define simultaneity relative to a single event of the internal perspective. So, the entity that "experiences" the simultaneous events is itself just a bit flip! That's not a very rich perspective to take.

[[../img/knuth-chain.png]]

A final set of approaches make an appeal to complexity: maybe a sufficiently tangled causal graph will have an /emergent/ notion of simultaneity relative to some (rich) internal perspective. I think these will always suffer from a bootstrapping problem. To group causal events together as "simultaneous", we first need to define an internal reference frame. But, any such reference frame must /itself/ be made of a group of causal events! We have an infinite regress.

[[../img/escher-hands.jpg]]

My take-away is to reject the idea that causal graphs have the necessary structure to account for multiple events being objectively grouped to the same conscious experience.

* Potential Resolutions

In presenting this argument to proponents of computation accounts for consciousness, I've seen a several interesting responses.

The first is to reject that conscious states have an objective nature (assumption 1.2). The keywords here are "illusionism", "eliminativist materialism", and consciousness being an "as-if" virtual property. On this I'll just say that my aim is to explain conscious experience, not explain it away.

Another take is to say that I dismissed emergence too quickly. Maybe looking for binding in causal graphs is like asking which atoms in you body are alive. It's simply the wrong level of description to find that property. As discussed in the previous section, I think that emergent objectivity is hard to imagine in this case. If you've found a way, please let me know!

The final take comes from constructivist philosophy, which takes the stance that the only computational languages can be used to build fundamental models of reality. From this point of view, there must be something wrong with the argument, since seems to rule out any computational description of binding. I think there may be a subtle middle ground where we can fully describe binding in computational terms, but can't instantiate it as a computation.

* Closing Thoughts

:END:

It's not easy for me to conclude that computer's can't be conscious. On one hand, it aligns with my intuition that we should not be worried about GPUs suffering, for example. On the other hand, I find many of the arguments for computationalists theories of mind compelling.

If we do reject conscious computation, then we need a framework beyond computation to explain our own consciousness. This does not necessarily imply physics has non-computable properties[fn:14]. Instead, we may find that even perfect simulations fail to capture certain properties of the reality they are simulating. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation][map is not the territory]], and maybe the "wholeness" in the territory gets inevitably lost in a computational map. Something like this seems to happen when we simulate quantum computers on traditional computers: the "wholeness" of the quantum state gets fractured in the simulation of that state. This fracturing comes at a cost: the simulation generally needs exponentially more resources than the quantum computer.

So why not just assert that our brain leverages some "wholeness" in physics (e.g. quantum entanglement) which classical computers don't have access to? This is the approach pursued by QRI, and I consider it a very worthwhile investigation. If true, it could provide a solution to the "binding problem"[fn:15] as well as explain why biological evolution favored bound conscious states: wholeness comes with a computational advantage similar (or identical) to the advantage we find in quantum computers.

Of course, there are also reasons to reject this approach. Some compiutationists have convinced themselves that, actually, the map /is/ the territory[fn:30]. Or, at least they no longer think the distinction is philosophically sound. As previously mentioned, this "constructivist turn" in the philosophy of mind asserts that the only meaningful languages we can use do describe /anything/ must be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)][constructive]]. This turns out to be equivalent to saying that all models of reality must be computable, and that referencing any property (e.g. "wholeness") beyond what can be computed is a form of sloppy thinking. They might explain the wholeness we see in quantum states as a property models made by observers embedded in a branching "multiway" computation[fn:16], not an property of reality itself.

Finally, maybe the objectivity of conscious states assumption should be discarded since it's not even clear that physical states can be objectively defined[fn:18]! So, why should we expect that for conscious states? This might then make this argument impotent for ruling-out conscious computation, but leaves many others [fn:3] which don't use the objectivity assumption.

* COMMENT TODO

- try again with one qscope that has full access to the complete description of the physical state / computation.
- mention consciousness as a process doesn't fix it
- use the fact that computational events are onotologically distinct -> clean causal graph
- qscopes measure bits, and can only agree on inference of objective causal structure of the computation that generated those bits. this is not the case in a more general physical case, where the bits generally come from wavefunction collapse
