title: Popularizing Quantum Contextuality

I've found very few expositions of quantum contextuality that are accessible to a non-technical audience. So, I've been iterating on a game that exposes the key ideas. Behind the scenes, it uses [[https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/ghz][GHZ states]] and an implicit assumption of locality to generate a paradox. No physics / math background is required to play.

After almost two years of showing it to friends, I'd like to post the details publicly. Check back here soon.

You can get a feel of it from this photo:

If you know of any good explanations of contextuality, please get in touch!
