AI-generated music has gotten very good. Here's what a few minutes of tinkering with [[https://suno.com/][Suno]] will get you. Lyrics mostly my own, inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObOqq1knVxs][That Funny Feeling]] by Bo Burnham.

* Lyrics

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Stunning 8K resolution deepfake of a cat
In order to prove you are human, the Orb is at the Gap
Lambda's self-awareness, loving chatbots, harmless fun
The backlash to the backlash to the race that can't be won

There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling

Praying for the warning shots, Sammy Altman's face
Sergei Brin is talking shop, Google's in the race
Female U.S. founders, easy answers, civil war
Your soulmate at your fingertips, a chatbot you adore

The live-action Lion King, Nano Banana Pro
20,000 years of this, then Elon steals the show
Sneaky Waluigi, Mecha Hitler, clever Claude
If anybody builds it, Yudkowsky has warned us all

There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling

Responsible scaling plans, system's going live
And obeying all the protocols in safety level five
Full-on technophobic, good luck living with no phone
A book on AI welfare hand delivered by a drone

LLM-induced psychosis, fully out your mind
Googling sycophancy, loving what you find
That un-apparent scheming model before the fall
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again, that funny feeling
That funny feeling

Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, you wait
Hey, what can you say? We were overdue
But it'll be over soon, just wait
(repeat and fade out)
