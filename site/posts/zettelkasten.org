I've jumped on the [[https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/][Zettelkasten]] hype-train, which has presumably been recently fueled by the well-deserved popularity of [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]]. I wish I'd done this years ago, as the effects are obviously compounding.

A Zettelkasten ("note box") is a method for effective note-taking. In this method, you produce a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy][heterarchy]] of concepts linked together in a directed graph. Since each note is contextualized via it's embedding in the graph, it's more likely to be discovered / made-useful in the future. The original Zettelkasten was a [[https://emvi.com/blog/luhmanns-zettelkasten-a-productivity-tool-that-works-like-your-brain-N9Gd2G4aPv][carefully curated set of physical notecards]], which seemingly enabled [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann][Niklas Luhmann]]'s impressive career. Of course, today we have digital tools to generate, navigate, and manipulate the graph.

As of this writing, I've generated over 300 nodes in my personal Zettelkasten over 5 weeks. I use [[https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/develop/tour/][org-roam]], which I strongly recommend to anyone already familiar with Emacs + Org Mode. For everyone else, well, [[https://www.gwern.net/][Gwern]] said it best:

"Friends don’t let friends use heroin or org-mode—are you ever really going to make back the time it takes to learn & customize org-mode?"
#+end_quote

Here's a peek at a part of my graph:

In both Roam and org-roam, I find that navigating via backlinks is more effective than via this graph visualization.

One downside of org-roam is that it's single-player only. For collaborative projects like the [[https://dangirsh.org/posts/foundations_journal_club.html][Foundations Journal Club]], using [[http://roamresearch.com/][Roam]] has been working well.
