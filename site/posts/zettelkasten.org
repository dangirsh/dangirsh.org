You may have noticed the recent [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]] hype, amplified by well-deserved popularity of [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]]. I've been following the tools emerging the space, and outline my personal explorations in this post. Note: I'm using tools designed for the Zettelkasten method, but not trying to faithfully implement the method itself.

Here's a simple model I'm trying for my digital brain: a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy][heterarchy]] of text entities, linked together in a graph. A node represents any concept that I care enough about to take notes on: a person, place, company, book, paper, technology, field, etc. An edge is automatically generated whenever the notes of one node reference another node, which enables the graph structure to grow passively and organically.

A note's embedding in the graph provides its /context/, which makes notes more likely to be found when they should be. This augments the utility of a note over time, which motivates me to take good notes.

I use [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] generate, navigate, and manipulate my graph (config [[https://dangirsh.org/projects/doom-config.html#org-roam-a-zettelkasten-based-on-roamresearch][here]]). If you're already familiar with Emacs + Org Mode, definitely try it out. For everyone else, [[https://www.gwern.net/][Gwern]] said it best:

#+begin_quote
"Friends don’t let friends use heroin or org-mode — are you ever really going to make back the time it takes to learn & customize org-mode?"
#+end_quote

Well, Gwern, I'm working on it. Here are some things I currently find useful to augment with the graph structure:

1. Executable code blocks (see [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org babel]] and [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter][emacs-jupyter]])
2. Notes linked to locations in PDFs (see [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][org-noter]] and [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex][org-roam-bibtex]])
3. TODOs - tasks generated while taking notes are automatically linked back to their originating graph context
4. Daily journal entries

The following are WIP:

1. Spaced repetition (via [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html][org-drill]])
2. Importing notes that predated the graph.

Here's a bird's-eye view of part of my graph (courtesy of [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]]):

As I learn more about what's possible with this representation, I'll update this post.
